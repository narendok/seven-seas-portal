## Module 1: Governed Inventory & Asset Management Architecture

### 1.1 Overview & Architecture
The Governed Inventory & Asset Management System integrates parts taxonomy, wire harness traceability, project-team material allocations, incoming quality control (IQC) holds, and serialized production assets into a unified IATF 16949 compliant surface:

- **Component & Parts Register (Tab 1)**: Authoritative part records with on-hand, released, held in IQC, allocated stock, storage location, and bin coordinates.
- **Wire Harness Assemblies (Tab 2)**: Project-linked wire harnesses classified under one primary category (`Wire Harnesses`) plus discovery cross-tags (`Mechanical` and `Electrical`).
- **Project-Team Material Issuance & Returns (Tab 3)**: Controlled material issuing with server-side roster verification. Only active members of a linked project can be assigned parts/harnesses.
- **Goods Received Note & IQC Hold (Tab 4)**: Official PO-led GRN receipt records with lot numbers, date codes, and accepted vs. held splits. Unreleased stock is strictly barred from issuance.
- **Governed Asset Register (Tab 5)**: Serialized capital equipment, SMT pick-and-place machinery, reflow ovens, and test jigs tracked separately from stock inventory, including machine compatibility links.
- **Stock Movement & Audit Log (Tab 6)**: Append-only immutable history recording every transaction (`Receipt`, `Issue`, `Return`, `Adjustment`, `QuarantineHold`, `QualityRelease`).

### 1.2 Step-by-Step Verified Workflow & Screenshots

#### Step 1: Governed Inventory Workspace Overview
The workspace provides real-time KPI counters (Total On-Hand, Released Stock, Held in IQC, Active Allocations, Reorder Alerts, and Serialized Machines) across 6 tabs.

![Governed Inventory Workspace](images/scms_demo_step1_inventory_view.png)

#### Step 2: Controlled Part Registration
Clicking `[+ Register Part]` opens the IATF 16949 component entry modal. Engineers provide Part Number, Description, Manufacturer, Package/Footprint, Storage Location, Bin Coordinate, Reorder Buffer, and Unit of Measure.

![Part Registration Dialog](images/scms_demo_step2_part_modal_filled.png)

#### Step 3: Verified Component Ingestion
Once saved, the part immediately appears in the authoritative register with assigned categories, locations, and real-time stock status.

![Part Registered in Table](images/scms_demo_step3_part_registered.png)

#### Step 4: Project-Team Material Issuance
Clicking `[Issue Material]` opens the server-scoped allocation modal. The recipient dropdown filters strictly to active team members of the linked project (e.g. `Avery Vale (EHW · Hardware Lead)` for project `HLPL-AI4T-01`). Zero-stock parts automatically disable issuance.

![Issue Material Dialog](images/scms_demo_step4_issue_modal_filled.png)

#### Step 5: Active Project Allocation Tracking (Tab 3)
Active allocations display the recipient, department, linked project, issued quantity, timestamp, issuer, and return action buttons (supporting partial or full returns).

![Active Project Allocation View](images/scms_demo_step5_active_allocation.png)

#### Step 6: Immutable Movement History & Audit Log (Tab 6)
Every stock delta creates an unalterable audit log entry containing the exact timestamp, actor, reason, lot number, quantity delta, and request key.

## Module 9: Purchasing Command Center & Department-Specific Sidebar Navigation

### 9.1 Overview & Architectural Integration
The Purchasing & Supply Chain Management (`PUR`) Command Center unifies commercial quotations, purchase orders, governed inventory stores, and supplier governance into a deeply interconnected digital workflow:

- **Department-Specific Sidebar Navigation**: When the sidebar is expanded (`w-64`), the `PUR` navigation rail renders four dedicated 1-click department sub-options:
  1. `Recordage`: Stores & Governed Inventory (Mouser lookup, Inward GRN, lot tracking, stock movements).
  2. `Quotations`: Commercial vendor quotations, volume price breaks (1k, 10k, 50k), lead times, and 1-click `[Convert to PO]`.
  3. `Purchase Orders`: Official PO register, 50,000 annual sales target coverage progress bar, batch delivery schedules, unit costs, inherited warranty terms, and 1-click `[📦 Receive GRN]`.
  4. `Suppliers (ASL)`: Approved Vendor List, supplier warranty terms, accreditation validity (IATF 16949 / ISO 9001 expiry dates, VDA 6.3 scores), verified documentation badges (PPAP L3, NDA, GST, RoHS/REACH), and comprehensive Supplier Dossier modals.
- **Mutual Cross-Linkage**:
  - Quotations seamlessly convert into active Purchase Orders, auto-locking MPN, price tier, and warranty terms.
  - POs inherit supplier warranty and accreditation validity from the ASL.
  - Issued POs feature 1-click `[Receive GRN]` which routes directly to Recordage & Stores for incoming receipt and IQC inspection.
  - Supplier cards link to their active POs and Quotations, with interactive Dossier modals for audit inspection.
- **Mouser Search API v1 Key Configuration**: Full support for entering and persistently storing a Mouser Search API key (`localStorage["scms_mouser_api_key"]` or `VITE_MOUSER_API_KEY`). When configured, live component specs, real-time pricing, stock levels, and datasheets are queried over the REST API, falling back gracefully to the offline verified automotive catalog.

### 9.2 Verified Screenshot Evidence

## Module 10: Role-Aware Sidebar Navigation with Favorites & Dynamic Accordion Work Groups

### 10.1 Architectural Overview & Core Capabilities
The Hexense Labs SCMS sidebar navigation adapts intelligently to the signed-in persona (`admin`, department leads, `client`):
- **Favorites System at Top**:
  - Always appears first with pinned items.
  - Hovering any item in any work group reveals a pin/unpin star trigger (`★`).
  - Pinned items persist across browser sessions in `localStorage` under `scms_user_favorites_${persona.id}`.
  - Sensible role-focused defaults:
    - **Executive Admin**: Overview, Projects, Work queue, Inventory, Procurement, Quality, Documents, People.
    - **Department Leads**: My work, Department queue, Active projects, Department primary workspace (e.g. for PUR: Recordage, Quotations, Orders, Suppliers).
- **Expandable Accordion Work Groups with Dynamic Arrow Rules**:
  - **Administrator View**:
    - Favorites is open at the top.
    - **`Overview`** section is **expanded by default** (with arrow pointing down `ChevronDown`).
    - **All remaining work groups** (`Commercial & Projects`, `Engineering & Delivery`, `Inventory & Procurement`, `Quality & Compliance`, `Documents & Collaboration`, `People & Organization`, `Administration`) start **unexpanded (collapsed)** by default with arrow pointing right (`ChevronRight`).
    - Clicking any group header toggles expansion, and navigating to any page automatically auto-expands its containing group.
  - **Department Lead View**:
    - "For others all expanded": All department work groups (`My work`, `Projects`, `Department workspace`, `Reference`) start **expanded by default** with downward chevrons, giving immediate visibility into all permitted department tasks, workflows, and documents.
- **Dual Display Modes**:
  - **Expanded View (`w-64`)**: Full company branding (`SS` monogram badge + Six Sense Mobility / Hexense Labs title), group headers, badges, open task counters, pin stars, and bottom setup wizard status.
  - **Compact Rail View (`w-16`)**: Icon-only navigation with tooltips on hover, active indicator badges, and one-click expand toggle (supporting `[` keyboard shortcut).
  - **Accessible Mobile Drawer**: Complete responsive drawer matching the exact desktop role-aware group structure.

## Module 11: Dual-Lifecycle Smart BOM Architecture & 'What-If' Stock Simulation

### 11.1 Architecture & Separation
The Smart BOM workspace ([`DualLifecycleSmartBOMWorkspace.tsx`](file:///c:/Users/Test/Documents/antigravity/SSM1/src/components/DualLifecycleSmartBOMWorkspace.tsx)) explicitly decouples exploratory engineering drafts from governed production releases:
- **Tentative Engineering Draft (`v0.3-tentative`)**: Permits provisional candidate MPNs, unverified components, generic placeholders, and dynamic "What-If" stock simulations.
- **Governed Released Baseline (`Rev A ECO-2026-004`)**: Immutable baseline locked to PPAP Level 3 documentation, AIS-140 TAC type approval, and production kitting. Changes require an authorized Engineering Change Order (ECO number and rationale).
- **Dynamic "What-If" Simulation**: Recalculates real-time shortages across active released stores for variable planned build quantities (e.g. 5,000 units: 5/7 shortage lines, deficit of $59,150.00).
- **Revision Diff Engine**: Side-by-side comparison across revisions (Base `Rev A` vs Target `v0.3-tentative`: +1 added, -1 removed, -$0.020 net unit cost delta).
- **Unified CSV Exports**: Indented Hierarchical BOM, Flattened Production BOM with comma-separated reference designators, and Shortage Requisition Report.

## Module 12: Adaptive Purchase Order & Invoice Ingestion Engine

### 12.1 Multi-Format Ingestion
The ingestion engine ([`AdaptiveIngestionAndStagingGate.tsx`](file:///c:/Users/Test/Documents/antigravity/SSM1/src/components/AdaptiveIngestionAndStagingGate.tsx)) handles arbitrary supplier spreadsheets from Digi-Key, Mouser, Arrow, and local fabricators:
- **Multi-Alias Dictionary Fuzzy Matcher**: Maps 16 standard fields with live matching confidence rating (120% High Confidence match) and dropdown column overrides.
- **Distributor Presets**: Mouser Electronics Packing List, Digi-Key Billed Invoice, Precision Wiring Delivery Challan, and Arrow Electronics Commercial Billing.

---

## Module 13: Governed Pre-Inventory Staging Gate & Zero Automatic Stock Posting

### 13.1 Pre-Inventory Staging Gate & 3-Way Reconciliation
All imported rows pass through a pre-inventory review gate prior to creating purchasing drafts or inward records:
- **Vendor Reconciliation**: Matches against Approved Supplier List (`procurement.vendors`).
- **Component Catalog Reconciliation**: Normalizes MPNs (stripping packaging suffixes `-ND`, `-REEL`, `/TR`) into `Exact Catalog Match`, `Approved Substitute Match`, or `Unmatched Candidate`.
- **PO Variance Detection**: Identifies billed vs. ordered quantity deviations and unauthorized unit price hikes.

### 13.2 The Zero-Automatic-Stock-Posting Invariant
Under no circumstances does an imported invoice or delivery challan increment active inventory balance.
Generating an inward delivery creates a pending **Inwarding (GRN) Draft** on **100% IQC Quarantine Hold** (`quantityAccepted: 0`, `quantityHeld: 100%`, bin `IQC-HOLD-STAGE-01`).
Active stock is only incremented when the Quality team executes an signed **IQC Disposition Release** (`QA-IR-2026-088`).

## Module 14: Complete Plant Machinery & Asset Lifecycle Management

### 14.1 Asset Fleet & Machine Compatibility Mapping
The asset management surface ([`LiveInventoryWorkspace.tsx`](file:///c:/Users/Test/Documents/antigravity/SSM1/src/components/LiveInventoryWorkspace.tsx)) tracks production machinery, service test equipment, IMTE calibration instruments, and facility tooling:
- **Machine-to-Component Compatibility**: Maps machines directly to compatible parts via `compatiblePartNumbers` (Yamaha SMT Mounter linked to MCUs/passives; Schleuniger CrimpCenter linked to battery harnesses; Chroma EOL Jig linked to main PCB).
- **Bulk CSV Ingestion**: Imports asset registers with serial number and tag deduplication.
- **Audit Schedule Exports**: 1-click downloads for `Asset Register Export (.csv)` and `Calibration & Maintenance Due Schedule (.csv)` (filtered to instruments due within 60 days).

---

## Module 15: Department Lead Authentication & Strict Role Confinement

### 15.1 Real Authentication Gateway & Confinement
- **IATF 16949 / ISO 27001 Security Gateway**: Accessible via `[🔑 Lead Auth]` in the header with credentials directory and eye toggle password visibility.
- **Strict Role Confinement**: When signed in as a Department Lead (e.g. Morgan Reed · Purchasing Lead), the user is confined strictly to their department workspace. The Persona Switcher dropdown is locked/hidden, preventing lateral access or administrative escalation.
- **Session Termination**: `[Sign Out of Current Session]` terminates the session and safely returns the user to the default gateway.

---

## Module 16: Department Lead Coordination Center, Team & Task Management, and Full-Page Approvals

### 16.1 Overview & Architecture
To eliminate cluttered tables and fragmented modals, the portal integrates the **Department Lead Coordination Center** ([`DepartmentLeadCoordinationCenter.tsx`](file:///c:/Users/Test/Documents/antigravity/SSM1/src/components/DepartmentLeadCoordinationCenter.tsx)) into all 11 department hubs, accompanied by a dedicated, full-page approvals surface:

- **1-Click Instant Assignee Switcher**: Every task card in Kanban and row in Table view features an inline assignee dropdown. Department Leads can instantly reallocate tasks across their team in zero clicks/dialogs.
- **Teams Tasks Hub**: Switchable between an interactive Kanban board and dense tabular view, complete with real-time project scoping, priority filtering, and status progression.
- **Department Projects Hub**: Tracks deliverables, APQP lifecycle stages, target delivery dates, and progress percentages (e.g. `HLPL-AI4T-01` Tata Ace EV 4G at 92%) with 1-click drill-downs into project-specific tasks.
- **Department Teams & Capacity Matrix**: Visualizes active workloads (e.g. `1 Tasks · 25% Capacity`), competency tiers (`Level 2` to `Level 4 - Advanced Specialist`), and core technical skill tags.
- **Full-Page Approvals View ([`ApprovalsFullPageView.tsx`](file:///c:/Users/Test/Documents/antigravity/SSM1/src/components/ApprovalsFullPageView.tsx))**: Replaces pop-up dialogs with a full-viewport governance center displaying digital signer authority, risk-classified decision cards (`CRITICAL`, `HIGH`, `MEDIUM`), IATF 16949 §8.3.4 regulatory clauses, and 1-click human sign-offs (`[Approve Gate]`, `[Return for Rework]`, `[Reject]`).
- **Sidebar Notification Cleanup**: Notification links have been removed from the sidebar. The interactive notification bell on the top header serves as the sole, non-cluttered alert center.

## Module 17: Living Update Protocol for Engineering Agents

When adding, modifying, or refactoring portal features:
1. **Pre-Check**: Read this Knowledge Base and [`SSM_ONE_WEB_PORTAL_MASTER_PLAN.md`](file:///c:/Users/Test/Documents/antigravity/SSM1/SSM_ONE_WEB_PORTAL_MASTER_PLAN.md) to understand existing data models and UI patterns.
2. **Execute Changes**: Apply TypeScript-strict modifications (`exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true`).
3. **Verify Locally**:
   - `npx tsc --noEmit` (ensure 0 type errors).
   - `npm run build` (ensure clean production bundle).
4. **Capture Visual Evidence**: Use the browser controller / Playwright script to capture screenshots into `docs/images/` and the conversation brain directory.
5. **Update Knowledge Base & Master Plan**:
   - Add new feature descriptions, parameters, and screenshots to this Knowledge Base.
   - Update [`SSM_ONE_WEB_PORTAL_MASTER_PLAN.md`](file:///c:/Users/Test/Documents/antigravity/SSM1/SSM_ONE_WEB_PORTAL_MASTER_PLAN.md) completed milestones and relevant sections.
6. **Git Sync**: Commit and push to `origin/main` without rewriting history to maintain Lovable synchronization.
